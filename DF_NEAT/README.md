Death Farts
An Utter MasterpieceTM By

This Utter MasterpieceTM is a loving homage to the late Flappy Bird mobile app game.
But what if instead of Flappy Bird, we played as DEATH RIDING A SCYTHE?!
And what if instead of wings flapping, it was in fact Death's flatulence propelling you forward?!
AND WHAT IF Death travelled from a Graveyard, through the River Styx, and into the fiery depths of Hell?!
WONDER NO MORE! Death Farts is here to quell all those curiosities!
